# Install Scripts for Linux Mint
An archive of my install scripts of packages that I use on Linux Mint systems

To Do List:
- [x] Remove redundant and unused package entries & repo entries (split off to separate file for archival)  
- [x] Update for Mint 21.x  
- [x] Add Optional Scripts    
- [ ] Update for Mint 22.x (on hold due to issues upgrading from Mint 21.x to Mint 22)
- [ ] Make an LMDE 6 version of the install script  
- [ ] Add curses for a text based GUI for selection of packages to install

Notes: 
- Vista ClearType Fonts script is intentionally not included due to the dependency on Microsoft's PowerPoint Viewer (refer [here](https://needforbits.wordpress.com/2017/07/19/install-microsoft-windows-fonts-on-ubuntu-the-ultimate-guide/) for a guide on how to install Vista ClearType fonts)
