# Install Scripts for Linux Mint
An archive of my install scripts of packages that I use on Linux Mint systems

To Do List:
- [x] Remove redundant and unused package entries & repo entries (split off to separate file for archival)  
- [ ] Update for Mint 21.x  
- [ ] Update for Mint 22.x (on hold due to issues upgrading from Mint 21.x to Mint 22)
- [ ] Make an LMDE 6 version of the install script  
- [ ] Add curses for a text based GUI for selection of packages to install
